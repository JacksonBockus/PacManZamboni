# PacManZamboni
This project is intended as a solution to [this problem](https://acmicpc.net/problem/11229), with one minor change: It ignores the extremely high (10<sup>18</sup>) upper limit for the number of moves that Pac Man might make on his zamboni. Yeah, it's that kind of problem. Obviously, it's not the kind of thing I'd write if I were in a competition setting; it's mainly supposed to be practice for good coding practices.
